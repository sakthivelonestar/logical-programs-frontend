                <p> <span class="question">What:</span>
                SQL subqueries and CTEs are <strong>nested queries and temporary named result sets that enable complex data retrieval, filtering, and analysis by breaking down complex problems into manageable, reusable components.</strong> </p>
            <p> <span class="question">Why:</span>
                SQL subqueries and CTEs are important because they <strong>improve query readability, enable complex filtering and calculations, support hierarchical data processing, and allow for modular query construction.</strong></p>
            <p> <span class="question">Where:</span>
                SQL subqueries and CTEs are used <strong>in complex reporting systems, data analysis, hierarchical data processing, and anywhere multi-step data transformations or complex filtering logic is required.</strong></p>

                <h4>Step 1: Basic Subqueries and Types</h4>
                <pre><code>-- Scalar subquery - Returns single value

    (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) as company_avg_salary,
    salary - (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees) as salary_difference
FROM employees
WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);

-- Column subquery - Returns single column, multiple rows
SELECT 
    employee_id,
    first_name,
    last_name,
    department_id
FROM employees
WHERE department_id IN (
    SELECT department_id 
    FROM departments 
    WHERE location = 'New York'

-- Row subquery - Returns multiple columns, single row
SELECT

    SELECT department_id, MAX(salary)

WHERE EXISTS (
    SELECT 1

    d.location
FROM departments d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (

    first_name,
    last_name,
    salary
FROM employees
WHERE salary > ALL (
    SELECT salary
