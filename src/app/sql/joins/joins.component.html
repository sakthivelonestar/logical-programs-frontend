                <p> <span class="question">What:</span>
                SQL joins and relationships are <strong>database operations used to combine data from multiple tables based on related columns, enabling access to interconnected information across normalized database structures.</strong> </p>
            <p> <span class="question">Why:</span>
                SQL joins and relationships are important because they <strong>eliminate data redundancy, maintain data integrity, enable complex queries across multiple tables, and support relational database design principles.</strong></p>
            <p> <span class="question">Where:</span>
                SQL joins and relationships are used <strong>in relational databases, data warehouses, reporting systems, and anywhere normalized data structures require combining information from multiple related tables.</strong></p>

                <h4>Step 1: Basic SQL Joins</h4>
                <pre><code>-- INNER JOIN - Returns records that have matching values in both tables
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

-- LEFT JOIN - Returns all records from left table, matched records from right table
SELECT e.employee_id, e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

-- RIGHT JOIN - Returns all records from right table, matched records from left table
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
RIGHT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

-- FULL OUTER JOIN - Returns all records when there's a match in either table
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
FULL OUTER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id;

-- CROSS JOIN - Returns Cartesian product of both tables (possible combinations)
SELECT e.first_name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
CROSS JOIN departments d;</code></pre>

                <h4>Step 2: Advanced Join Techniques</h4>
                <pre><code>-- Multiple table joins

INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
INNER JOIN employee_projects ep ON e.employee_id = ep.employee_id
INNER JOIN projects p ON ep.project_id = p.project_id;

-- Self JOIN - Join table with itself
SELECT e1.first_name AS employee, e2.first_name AS manager
FROM employees e1
LEFT JOIN employees e2 ON e1.manager_id = e2.employee_id;

-- Join with aggregation
SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(e.employee_id) as employee_count, AVG(e.salary) as avg_salary
FROM departments d
LEFT JOIN employees e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY d.department_id, d.department_name;

-- Join with conditions in WHERE clause
SELECT e.first_name, e.last_name, d.department_name, e.salary
FROM employees e
INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE e.salary > 60000 AND d.department_name IN ('IT', 'Finance');

-- Join with subqueries
