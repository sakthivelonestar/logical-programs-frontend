                <p> <span class="question">What:</span>
                SQL aggregation functions are <strong>built-in functions that perform calculations on a set of values and return a single result, enabling data summarization and statistical analysis across database records.</strong> </p>
            <p> <span class="question">Why:</span>
                SQL aggregation functions are important because they <strong>enable data analysis, statistical calculations, report generation, and business intelligence by summarizing large datasets into meaningful insights.</strong></p>
            <p> <span class="question">Where:</span>
                SQL aggregation functions are used <strong>in data analysis, reporting systems, business intelligence dashboards, and anywhere statistical summaries or calculations are needed from database records.</strong></p>

                <h4>Step 1: Basic Aggregation Functions</h4>
                <pre><code>-- COUNT - Returns the number of rows or non-null values
SELECT COUNT(*) as total_employees FROM employees;
SELECT COUNT(department_id) as employees_with_department FROM employees;

-- SUM - Returns the sum of numeric values
SELECT SUM(salary) as total_payroll FROM employees;
SELECT SUM(hours_worked) as total_hours FROM timesheets;

-- AVG - Returns the average of numeric values
SELECT AVG(salary) as average_salary FROM employees;
SELECT AVG(age) as average_age FROM employees;

-- MIN - Returns the minimum value
SELECT MIN(salary) as lowest_salary FROM employees;
SELECT MIN(hire_date) as earliest_hire_date FROM employees;

-- MAX - Returns the maximum value
SELECT MAX(salary) as highest_salary FROM employees;
SELECT MAX(hire_date) as latest_hire_date FROM employees;</code></pre>

-- HAVING clause for filtering groups
