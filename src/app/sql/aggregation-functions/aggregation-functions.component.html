            <p> <span class="question">What:</span>
                Array methods in JavaScript are <strong>built-in functions that can be used on arrays to manipulate, transform, and extract data from them.</strong> </p>
            <p> <span class="question">Why:</span>
                Array methods are important because they <strong>provide efficient ways to work with collections of data, reduce code complexity, and enable functional programming patterns.</strong></p>
            <p> <span class="question">Where:</span>
                Array methods are used <strong>throughout JavaScript applications for data processing, filtering, sorting, transformation operations, and whenever working with collections of items.</strong></p>

SELECT AVG(salary) AS average_salary FROM employees;
SELECT MAX(salary) AS highest_salary FROM employees;

-- Grouping data
SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS employee_count

-- Grouping with conditions
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary

-- Multiple aggregations
