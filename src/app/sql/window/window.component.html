                <p> <span class="question">What:</span>
                SQL window functions are <strong>functions that perform calculations across a set of rows related to the current row, without collapsing the result set into groups, enabling advanced analytics and rankings within query results.</strong> </p>
            <p> <span class="question">Why:</span>
                SQL window functions are important because they <strong>enable advanced analytics like running totals, rankings, percentiles, and comparative analysis while preserving individual row details in the result set.</strong></p>
            <p> <span class="question">Where:</span>
                SQL window functions are used <strong>in business intelligence, data analytics, reporting dashboards, and anywhere advanced calculations or rankings are needed without grouping data.</strong></p>
