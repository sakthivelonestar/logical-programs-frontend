                <p> <span class="question">What:</span>
                SQL stored procedures and functions are <strong>precompiled, reusable database objects that encapsulate complex business logic, data processing operations, and calculations while providing better performance, security, and maintainability.</strong> </p>
            <p> <span class="question">Why:</span>
                SQL stored procedures and functions are important because they <strong>improve performance through precompilation, enhance security by preventing SQL injection, enable code reusability, centralize business logic, and provide better transaction control.</strong></p>
            <p> <span class="question">Where:</span>
                SQL stored procedures and functions are used <strong>in enterprise applications, data processing pipelines, complex business rule implementations, reporting systems, and anywhere performance-critical database operations are required.</strong></p>
