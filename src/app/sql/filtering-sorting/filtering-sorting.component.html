                <p> <span class="question">What:</span>
                    SQL sorting and filtering help you find and arrange specific data in a table based on conditions or order.
                </p>
                <p> <span class="question">Why:</span>
                    They make it easier to get the exact data you need, especially from large tables.
                </p>
                <p> <span class="question">Where:</span>
                    Used in database searches, reports, dashboards, and any place where data needs to be filtered or sorted.

                <h4>Step 1: Basic SQL Filtering</h4>
                <pre><code>-- Filter by single condition
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > 50000;

-- Filter by multiple conditions
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT' AND salary > 60000;

-- Filter with OR conditions
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'IT' OR department = 'HR';

-- Filter with IN operator
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department IN ('IT', 'Finance', 'Marketing');

-- Filter with LIKE operator for text matching
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%';

-- Filter with BETWEEN for ranges
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary BETWEEN 40000 AND 80000;

-- Filter with NOT operator
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department != 'HR';</code></pre>

                <h4>Step 2: SQL Sorting Techniques</h4>
                <pre><code>-- Sort by single column (ascending - default)
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary;

-- Sort by single column (descending)
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Sort by multiple columns
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;

-- Sort by calculated values
SELECT first_name, last_name, salary, salary * 12 as annual_salary
FROM employees ORDER BY annual_salary DESC;

-- Sort with NULL handling
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY bonus_amount DESC NULLS LAST;

-- Sort by string length
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY LENGTH(first_name);

-- Sort by date
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY hire_date DESC;</code></pre>
                <p>Various SQL sorting techniques using ORDER BY clause with different data types and conditions.</p>

                <h4>Step 3: Sorting and Limiting Results</h4>
                <pre><code>-- Sort by single column
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Sort by multiple columns
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;

-- Limit number of results
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Pagination with LIMIT and OFFSET
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY employee_id LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;

-- Top earners in each department
SELECT department, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > 50000
ORDER BY department, salary DESC;

-- Advanced filtering and sorting
SELECT employee_id, first_name, last_name, department, salary
FROM employees 
WHERE hire_date > '2020-01-01' 
  AND salary BETWEEN 45000 AND 100000
ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC
LIMIT 15;</code></pre>
