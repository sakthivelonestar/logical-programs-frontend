            <p> <span class="question">What:</span>
                Array methods in JavaScript are <strong>built-in functions that can be used on arrays to manipulate, transform, and extract data from them.</strong> </p>
            <p> <span class="question">Why:</span>
                Array methods are important because they <strong>provide efficient ways to work with collections of data, reduce code complexity, and enable functional programming patterns.</strong></p>
            <p> <span class="question">Where:</span>
                Array methods are used <strong>throughout JavaScript applications for data processing, filtering, sorting, transformation operations, and whenever working with collections of items.</strong></p>

                <h4>Step 3: Sorting and Limiting Results</h4>
                <pre><code>-- Sort by single column
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC;

-- Sort by multiple columns
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY department ASC, salary DESC;

-- Limit number of results
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY salary DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Pagination with LIMIT and OFFSET
SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY employee_id LIMIT 10 OFFSET 20;

-- Top earners in each department
SELECT department, first_name, last_name, salary
FROM employees 
WHERE salary > 50000
ORDER BY department, salary DESC;</code></pre>
