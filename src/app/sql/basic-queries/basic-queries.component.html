                <p><span class="question">What:</span>
                    Basic SQL queries are <strong>fundamental database operations that allow you to retrieve, add, modify, and remove data from database tables using structured commands.</strong></p>
                <p><span class="question">Why:</span>
                    SQL queries are essential because they <strong>form the foundation of all database interactions, enable efficient data manipulation and retrieval, power business applications, and are critical for data-driven decision making.</strong></p>
                <p><span class="question">Where:</span>
                    SQL is used <strong>in web applications, mobile apps, data analytics platforms, business intelligence systems, e-commerce sites, banking systems, and any application that needs to store or retrieve structured data.</strong></p>

-- Complete table cleanup (use with extreme caution)

-- Better approach: TRUNCATE TABLE employees;</code></pre>
